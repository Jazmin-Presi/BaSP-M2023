## Week 03
During this week we applied the knowledge of CSS we learned on class. The goal was to copy the aesthetic of the landing page designed on figma. We took the HTML we created and modified it to add styles in CSS and link a stylesheet. We also included a reset.css file to erase previous default styles.
