## Week 02
This week the asignment was to transfer the information displayed on the landing page into an HTML file. The tools utilized for this task were Git, Github and Visual Studio Code.
## Sections
The following are the main sections included from the landing page:

- Title and logo
- Navegation sidebar
- Presentation
- History of the company
- Activities
- Memberships
- Functionalities
- Form
- Footer

## Week 03
During this week we applied the knowledge of CSS we learned on class. The goal was to copy the aesthetic of the landing page designed on figma. We took the HTML we created and modified it to add styles in CSS and link a stylesheet. We also included a reset.css file to erase previous default styles.

## Week 04
The fourth week was dedicated to optimize the landing page to obtain a responsive design that functions on mobile as well as tablet and desktop. This assignment was based on the concept of mobile first and the main tool utilized during the development process was flexbox.

## Github Pages
Github pages was enabled to visualize the online preview.

```
## Week 05
During this week we made use of the content we learned about javascript. We solved various exercises starting with basic theory about variables and operators. The exercises had an increasing difficulty up to more complex content such as functions.

## Week 06
This week we applied the knowledge gained during the previous assignment about javascript. We designed the layout for both a log-in and a sign-up form based on the aesthetic used on Figma. Then we developed the javascript logic, including the corresponding validations for each field in the form.
